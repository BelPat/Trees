An AVL (Adelson-Velskii and Landis) tree, is a binary search tree, in which all
subtree satisfies:

- The left subtree, where are located the keys smaller than the root.
- The right subtree, where are located the keys larger than the root.
- Faith (T ') = 0, fe (T') = 1 or faith (T ') = -1, 
	where k is the balance factor of a binary tree T:

	faith (T) = depth (left (T))-depth (right (T))
